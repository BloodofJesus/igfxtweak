# igfxtweak
Intel Graphics tweak tool

igfxtweak provides access to dithering settings of Intel GPUs, which support 4 dithering configurations:
- Spatial
- Spatio-Temporal
- Spatio-Temporal 2
- Temporal

Since Intel intentionally disables dithering and FRC for external displays with <8bpc
and Intel Graphics Control Panel doesn't provide a corresponding option, this tool may
be used as a workaround.

igfxtweak requires administrator privileges to execute properly.
